<h1>{{#_}}About{{/_}}</h1> 

<p>{{#_}}The City of Cambridge is launching a pilot Participatory Budgeting (PB) process in which <strong>community members will directly decide how to spend $500,000 in FY 2016 capital funds.</strong>{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Participatory Budgeting is a democratic process through which community members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget. Cambridge’s pilot PB project will for the first time, directly involve residents in the budgeting and City-building process, foster civic engagement and community spirit, and help ensure that the City’s Capital Plan reflects the priorities of Cambridge residents.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Since its inception in 1989, over 1,500 city budgets around the world have undertaken Participatory Budgeting initiatives, including Boston, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Vallejo, CA.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}The City is setting aside <strong>$500,000</strong> in capital funds for the 2014-2015 PB process. These funds will be used for one-time capital projects. Residents will brainstorm ideas for projects, develop them into proposals, and projects that are vetted by City staff and approved by the City Manager will appear on a ballot in March for residents to vote on.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Winning projects will be included in the FY 2016 Capital Budget for adoption.{{/_}}</p>
